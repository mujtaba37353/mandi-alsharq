# Branch Management - Owner Admin

## Overview
This document outlines the use cases for branch management by the owner admin, including branch creation, configuration, and monitoring.

## Use Cases

### 1. Create New Branch

#### Workflow Description
1. Owner admin logs into the system
2. Navigates to branch management section
3. Initiates new branch creation
4. Enters branch details (name, location, contact info)
5. Configures branch settings (operating hours, delivery radius)
6. System validates the information
7. System creates the branch
8. System generates branch credentials
9. Owner admin receives confirmation

    participant OA as Owner Admin
    participant UI as User Interface
    participant BS as Branch Service
    participant DB as Database
    
    OA->>UI: Navigate to Branch Management
    UI->>OA: Display Branch Creation Form
    OA->>UI: Enter Branch Details
    UI->>BS: Submit Branch Creation Request
    BS->>DB: Validate Branch Data
    DB-->>BS: Validation Result
    BS->>DB: Create Branch Record
    DB-->>BS: Created Branch
    BS->>BS: Generate Branch Credentials
    BS-->>UI: Return Success Response
    UI-->>OA: Display Success Message
```

### 2. Configure Branch Settings

#### Workflow Description
1. Owner admin selects a branch
2. Views current branch settings
3. Modifies settings (operating hours, delivery radius, etc.)
4. System validates changes
5. System updates branch configuration
6. Owner admin receives confirmation

#### Sequence Diagram
```mermaid

    participant OA as Owner Admin
    participant UI as User Interface
    participant BS as Branch Service
    participant DB as Database
    
    OA->>UI: Select Branch
    UI->>BS: Request Branch Settings
    BS->>DB: Fetch Branch Data
    DB-->>BS: Return Branch Data
    BS-->>UI: Display Settings
    OA->>UI: Modify Settings
    UI->>BS: Submit Changes
    BS->>DB: Update Branch Settings
    DB-->>BS: Confirm Update
    BS-->>UI: Return Success
    UI-->>OA: Display Confirmation
```

### 3. Monitor Branch Performance

#### Workflow Description
1. Owner admin accesses analytics dashboard
2. Selects branch to monitor
3. Views performance metrics (orders, revenue, etc.)
4. Filters data by time period
5. System generates reports
6. Owner admin reviews performance

#### Sequence Diagram
```mermaid

    participant OA as Owner Admin
    participant UI as User Interface
    participant AS as Analytics Service
    participant DB as Database
    
    OA->>UI: Access Analytics Dashboard
    UI->>AS: Request Branch Performance
    AS->>DB: Fetch Performance Data
    DB-->>AS: Return Analytics Data
    AS->>AS: Process Data
    AS-->>UI: Return Processed Data
    UI-->>OA: Display Performance Metrics
```

## Integration Points
- Branch Service
- Analytics Service
- User Management Service
- Notification Service

## Business Rules
1. Only owner admin can create new branches
2. Branch settings can only be modified by owner admin
3. Performance metrics are updated in real-time
4. Branch creation requires valid location data
5. Operating hours must be within legal limits

## Error Handling
1. Invalid branch data
2. Duplicate branch location
3. Invalid operating hours
4. System errors during creation
5. Database connection issues

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for branch creation
2. Integration tests for settings update
3. Performance tests for analytics
4. Security tests for admin access
5. End-to-end tests for complete workflows
